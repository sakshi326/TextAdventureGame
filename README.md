Adventure Game - Text-Based RPG (Story Telling)
Overview
Welcome to the Adventure Game! This is a simple text-based role-playing game where you explore different rooms, interact with NPCs, collect items, fight enemies, and unravel the story. The game is designed around exploration, interaction, and a bit of combat. It’s all about making choices and experiencing a story unfold based on your decisions.

Features
Explore different rooms: Navigate through rooms like the Entrance, Forest, Dungeon, and Treasure Room.
Items and Inventory: Collect items like Potion and Sword that help you along the way.
NPC Interactions: Talk to NPCs, such as an old man who gives hints, or a friendly merchant.
Combat System: Fight enemies like the Goblin in the Dungeon.
Win and Lose Conditions: Reach the Treasure Room with the Key and win the game, or lose if your health reaches zero.

How to Play
Start the Game: When you run the game, you will be prompted with commands and options. Use the following commands to interact:

go [direction]: Move between rooms. Example: go north.
check inventory: Check the items you’ve collected so far.
look around: View items and NPCs in your current room.
take [item name]: Pick up items in the room.
use [item name]: Use an item from your inventory, such as healing potions.
talk to [NPC name]: Talk to NPCs for hints or help.
quit: Exit the game.
Fighting Enemies: If you encounter an enemy (e.g., the Goblin), you will have to fight it. Choose to attack, run, or heal using potions. Your health is important—if it drops to zero, you lose the game.

Talking to NPCs: Some rooms contain NPCs, such as the Old Man in the Forest. They offer hints and sometimes give you items or advice.

Winning the Game: To win, you need to:

Collect the Key from the Dungeon.
Use the key to enter the Treasure Room.
Collect the treasure and win!
Losing the Game: If your health reaches zero, you lose the game. You will have to restart from the beginning.
